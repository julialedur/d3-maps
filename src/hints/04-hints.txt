Honestly, every map starts out like 90% the same way. Steal code from the first map.








What's the layer name in your topojson?















Use console.log to check it out















Pls change the class name so it isn't 'country' because hey they aren't countries























Your projection can be found on https://github.com/d3/d3-geo if you can't find it in your notes




















Your fill is a little tricky since your data is coming in from topojson. Use console.log on your d!




























How do you calculate what you're going to map?!
























You might think one candidate divided by the other, with '1' as the middle, but think about if 1 out of a million voted for a candidate, and 999999 voted for the other. How would that look at the top/bottom of your scale?

























You'll want to think of it in terms of % of total vote. You'll need to add! You'll need to divide! It's math time!
