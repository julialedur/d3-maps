Copy and paste from Map 5! But change the size and the margins and the whole like uh svg append part.

    projection.fitSize([width, height], states)












To capitalize, you'll want to look at the end of the last hints file. It won't be exactly the same since `d` isn't the name of your power source, but it'll be close!












If you can't see your text, make sure it isn't below your other layers!
