You'll need to read in TWO files, the world file and the cities file.












So you need to change both the part where you read in the data AND the ready function










Remember, one is json and one is a csv!
















The background goes on the svg, as .style and not .attr

**NOT** the g, it won't work! You could also draw a black rectangle across the back of the map, though, if you wanted to leave the svg untouched.

















When you're making your scale, instead of using a scaleLinear() you can use a scaleSequential! It's basically the same thing, except you give it one of these color scales instead of a range: https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic

For example, if you previously had

    colorScale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range(['white', 'red'])

Instead you'd get rid of the .range part and feed it one of the scale interpolators

    colorScale = d3.scaleSequential(d3.interpolateReds).domain([0, 100])

What's an interpolator? Just a fancy way of saying "how to transition from your first color to your second color" (or to a third, fourth, fifth, or sixth color! Check out d3.interpolateRainbow)







Experiment with adding .clamp(true) onto your scale. What changes?





pay attention to your column names when you're using the coordinates for your cities!
